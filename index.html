<p>Hi, thanks for finding your way here. Due to low visitor numbers and rising costs of web hosting we have taken the decision to pause our services.</p>

<p>We still believe that you should be able to keep yourself safe online. There are some simple steps you can take now. 

<ul>
  <li>Move your router away from your window so no one can see the passwords on the back of it.</li>
  <li>Set your social media profiles to private so strangers can't see your posts.</li>
  <li>Use complex passwors with a mixture of Uppercase, lowercase letters, Numbers and Symbols.</li>
<li>Don't use the same password for every account.</li>
 <li>Use multifactor authentication to add a second layer of security on your accounts. </li>
  <li>Your bank or HMRC will never call or email you asking you to give them your personal details.</li>
<li>If you are ever unsure if a call or email is legit. Hangup, do not respond and contact the company via their trusted communication platforms.</li>
</ul>

<p> Stay safe folks and hopefully we will be back soon!</p>
</body>
