<p>Ooops, looks like you're a little late joining the party! </br></br>
Thanks for finding your way here. Due to low visitor numbers and rising costs of web hosting we have taken the decision to pause our services.</p>
</br>
<p>We still believe that you should be able to keep yourself safe online. There are some simple steps you can do right now to protect yourself online.</p>
<p></p>


<ul>
  <li>Move your router away from your window so no one can see the passwords on the back of it.</li></br>
  <li>Set your social media profiles to private so strangers can't see your posts.</li></br>
  <li>Use complex passwords with a mixture of UPPERCASE and lowercase letters, Numbers and Symbols.</br>Or, choose 3 random words - Example: <span><b>CamelSundaysHamper159</b></span></li></br>
  <li>Don't use the same password for every account.</li></br>
  <li>Use multifactor authentication to add a second layer of security on your accounts. Most big services offer this now.</li></br>
  <li>Your bank or other finacial institutions will never call or email you asking you to give them your personal details. </br>If you are ever unsure if a call or email is legit. Hangup, do not respond and contact the company via their trusted communication platforms.</li>
</ul>

</br>
<p> Stay safe folks and hopefully we will be back soon!</p>
